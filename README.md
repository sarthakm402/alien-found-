# Isometric Room Project

## Overview

This project involves creating an isometric room in Blender, a popular open-source 3D modeling and animation software. The isometric room is designed to provide a unique 2D-like perspective with a 3D appearance, often used in games and simulations for its distinctive visual style.
## Features

- Isometric Perspective: The room is modeled with an isometric view, providing a 30-degree angle that eliminates distortion of scale and proportion.

- Detailed Modeling: Includes various assets such as furniture, lighting, and decor to create a realistic and engaging environment. 

- Texture and Material Application: Textures and materials are applied to give a realistic look to the room and its contents. 

- Lighting Setup: Proper lighting is configured to enhance the visual appeal and provide appropriate shadows and highlights.
